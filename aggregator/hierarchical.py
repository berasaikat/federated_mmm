    Computes a shrinkage estimator for the federated posterior means.
    
    For each channel:
      global_mu = (1 - shrinkage) * fedavg_mu + shrinkage * grand_mean
    where grand_mean is the mean of the fedavg_mu across all channels.
    
    This acts as a hierarchical prior pulling extreme idiosyncratic channel estimates
    towards the global channel average, which is particularly useful 
    when some participants have high-uncertainty posteriors or scarce data.
    
    Args:
        list_of_summaries: A list of dicts (one per participant), each with channel keys mapped to {"mean": float, "std": float}.
        shrinkage: The shrinkage hyperparameter (0.0 to 1.0). 0 means no shrinkage (pure fedavg), 1 means full shrinkage (all channels equal grand_mean).
        
    Returns:
        A dict representing the new globally aggregated and hierarchically shrunk posterior summary.
